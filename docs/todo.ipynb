    "# Langchain Contribution Guide\n",
    "Based on the LangChain integration contribution documentation, your next steps should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a standalone package** for your Meta Llama integration:\n",
    "   - Chat Models are explicitly listed as encouraged integrations âœ…\n",
    "   - Create a new GitHub repository for your integration\n",
    "   - Structure it according to their package template\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement standard tests**:\n",
    "   - Add tests that verify basic functionality\n",
    "   - Include compatibility tests with LangChain interfaces\n",
    "   - Ensure both synchronous and asynchronous methods work\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Publish your package to PyPI**:\n",
    "   - Name it following their convention (likely `langchain-meta-llama`)\n",
    "   - Include proper dependencies in your `pyproject.toml`\n",
    "   - Ensure it has a clear README with usage examples\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add documentation**:\n",
    "   - Create documentation in the `docs/docs/integrations` directory of the LangChain repo\n",
    "   - Include setup instructions and usage examples\n",
    "   - Highlight the unique features of Meta's native API\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Submit a PR to LangChain**:\n",
    "   - For the documentation addition\n",
    "   - Reference your published package\n",
    "\n",
    "Your integration is particularly valuable since it's for a Chat Model, which is one of their priority integration categories. The documentation also mentions potential for co-marketing opportunities if your integration provides educational value to the community.\n",
